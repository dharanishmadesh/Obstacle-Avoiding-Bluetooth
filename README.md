**Code Example (Excerpt):**

```c++
void loop() {
  // Read sensor data
  int distance = readUltrasonicSensor(); 
  int irSensorValue = analogRead(IR_SENSOR_PIN); 

  // Check for obstacles
  if (distance < OBSTACLE_THRESHOLD || irSensorValue > IR_THRESHOLD) {
    // Stop the robot
    stopRobot(); 
    // Implement obstacle avoidance logic (e.g., turn, reverse) 
    // ...
  } else {
    // Check for Bluetooth commands
    if (Serial.available() > 0) {
      char command = Serial.read(); 
      switch (command) {
        case 'F': // Forward
          moveForward(); 
          break;
        case 'B': // Backward
          moveBackward();
          break;
        case 'L': // Left
          turnLeft();
          break;
        case 'R': // Right
          turnRight();
          break;
        case 'S': // Stop
          stopRobot();
          break;
      }
    } else {
      // Continue moving forward
      moveForward(); 
    }
  }
}
```
